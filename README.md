# RECESS-TERM-2 
Data Science and Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the Recess Data Science and Machine Learning project repository!

## Overview

This repository contains all the code and materials related to our data science and machine learning project at Recess. In this project, we have been working on various data analysis tasks, visualizations, and machine learning models.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Data`: This directory contains the datasets we have used for our analysis and modeling.
- `Notebooks`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks where we have performed data analysis, visualization, and built machine learning models.
- `weeks`: showing the work we did on a particular day of the a week
- `Reports`: This directory contains any reports, presentations, or documentation related to our project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/recess-data-science.git
```

Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed on your machine to run the Jupyter notebooks.

## Running the Notebooks

To run the Jupyter notebooks, navigate to the `Notebooks` directory and launch Jupyter Notebook. Then, open the desired notebook to explore the code and results.

## Contributions

We encourage contributions to this project! If you find any issues or have ideas for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Let's continue exploring and analyzing data together!

Happy coding!
